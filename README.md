                                                ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed Test App

Project Overview :

This is a modern, web-based typing speed test application that measures a user's typing proficiency. Built with a focus on simplicity and accuracy, the app provides an engaging way for users to practice and improve their typing skills. It calculates key metrics such as Words Per Minute (WPM), accuracy, and highlights incorrect words in real-time. This project is a great demonstration of dynamic UI updates, state management, and event-driven programming.

Key Features ‚ú®:

Real-Time Metrics: Instantly displays WPM and accuracy as the user types.

Dynamic Text: 
Fetches new paragraphs of text for testing, providing a fresh challenge with each new session.

Visual Feedback: Correctly typed words turn green, while incorrect words are highlighted in red for clear visual feedback.

Progress Bar: A progress bar visually indicates how much of the test text has been completed.

Responsive Design: The application is fully optimized for all device sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
HTML5: Provides the semantic structure for the application's interface.

CSS3: Used for styling, including the dynamic word highlighting and responsive layout.

JavaScript (ES6+): The core logic for handling user input, calculating WPM and accuracy, and managing the UI's state.

Typing Text: A collection of pre-defined text snippets stored as an array in JavaScript.

Project Architecture & File Structure üìÅ
The project's structure is clean and follows a simple, single-page architecture.

/typing-speed-test-app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html           # The main entry point containing the UI structure.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css            # Stylesheet for all visual components.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js            # Contains all core JavaScript logic.

How to Use üöÄ
Open the application in your web browser.

The test will automatically begin. Start typing the text displayed in the box.

The application will automatically track your progress, WPM, and accuracy.

Why This Project is Valuable üëç
This project is a solid portfolio piece that demonstrates key frontend development skills:

Event Handling: Capturing and processing keyboard input to drive the application's core functionality.

State Management: Efficiently managing the state of the test, including the current word, WPM, and accuracy.

String Manipulation: Working with text data to compare user input against the test paragraph.

UI/UX: Providing a clean and intuitive user interface with helpful real-time feedback.

Performance Optimization: Ensuring smooth performance even with rapid user input.

Future Enhancements üîÆ

Timed Tests: Add an option for timed tests (e.g., 60 seconds) instead of paragraph-based tests.

Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard using a backend or local storage to track and compare scores.

User Accounts: Allow users to create accounts to save their progress and view their typing history.

Custom Text: Enable users to paste their own text for a custom typing test.
